# ONZO API Challenge

This coding kata will focus in on interacting with ONZO's [Engagement API](http://apidocs.onzodata.com/engagement/v2/). In order to keep things relatively simple we would like you to;

1. Authenticate with the API (the person you're working with can provide credentials)
2. Work out the most recent date with 28 day breakdown available
3. Retrieve this 28 day breakdown
4. Rank the highest, lowest and midpoint consumption categories by cost

## Ground Rules

* Use the API documentation linked above
* Communicate your thought process. This is about going on the journey together
* Use Google and documentation as you see fit (this isn't a memory test)
* You can't curl, bash script or use postman
